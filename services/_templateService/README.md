## Backend Service Dev Cycle

Basic Philosophy: Be strict with the border, liberal on what is inside.

In the docs folder, there is a checklist of tasks that help define the 'border'.

-   Make sure io is defined and documented
-   Make sure you have 90%+ test coverage
-   Make sure a general summary is given for the service to help other developers.

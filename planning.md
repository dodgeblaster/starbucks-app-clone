# initial ideas
Make an app that mimics what a company like starbucks would want.
- have users
- users can order coffee
- have clerks
- clerks and process orders from til
- have tv views for store front
- have managers
- managers can manage what each store has in stock
- have shipping app
- shipping automatically gets store stock info and gets tasks to ship items to stores

## so for clients:
- customer
- clerk
- manager
- stock / shipping
- storefront-screens

## for backend services:
- products
- stores
- users (type customer, clerk, manager, stocker)
- promotions
- billing
- shipping
